## Tricky Pointers ! Hint: this shit is painful

- int *x = malloc(sizeof(int));
- *x = 42;
- int *y = x;
- int *z = '*'x;
- int &zz = '&'x;
- NOTE
  - '*' is the dereference operator
  - & is the address operator, gives you the address of an item
    - address of operator

## More on Pointers !!! God i love pointers !!

- a pointer can point to an array in memory
- recall: an array is a contiguous chunk of memory, indexable from zero
- never declare variables of type void*
- remember: you are smarter than the compiler. you must be fully aware of the types of the variables you are dealing with at all times
- but how much memory should I be allocating?
  - use sizeof()
- passing a variable into af unction copies the value of that variable
