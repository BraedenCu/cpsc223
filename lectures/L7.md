## Counting Sort

- Assume input has a limited array of range 0 < A[k] < k
  - List of integers with a known maximum value
- Steps
  - Phase One -> O(nk) runtime
    - scan array, find largest value k
    - make array of size k+1, all entries zero
    - scan array again, each time increasing count
  - Phase Two
    - for all entries of count array, k iterations total time O(n+k)
  - O(n)

### Tricky Pointers

- int *x = malloc(sizeof(int));
- *x = 42;
- int *y = x;
- int *z = '*'x;
- int &zz = '&'x;
- NOTE
  - '*' is the dereference operator
  - & is the address operator, gives you the address of an item
    - address of operator
