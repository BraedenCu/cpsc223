## Programming in C

### The Main Function
- two main arguments, argc and argv
- or no argument function -> ```int main(void){}```

### Variables in C
- staticly typed language
  - all variables must have types
- weakly typed language
  - looser typing rules, make produce unpredictable results

### Built-in Types
- int 
  - integer type
- char
  - character type
- double
  - double-precision floating point number
- float
  - single-precision floating point number
- long
  - long-integer
- array
- pointers
- ***everything*** we do in C is based on these types

### Functions
```c
int sqrt(int x) { // int = return type
    int the_sqrt = x; // beginning of function body
    return the_sqrt;
}
```
- functions are the building blocks of a C program
- Abstract implementation details away for simplicity
- Reduce or eliminate repeated code
- Using functions
  - to call a function, use its name followed by an argument list in parenthesis
    - the number and types of the arguments MUST match the formal parameters in the functions signature
  - Control is transferred from the calling function to the body of the function
```c
int sqrt(int x); // this is a function prototype, these will typically appear in the header file
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int s = sqrt(169);
    printf("%d\n", s);
}
```
- function prototypes provide the name and arguments of a function, but not the implementation. These are typically seen in header files


### Control Flow in C
- if/else 
  - essential control flow statements, everything can be built using only these
  - ```if(condition) {} else {}```
- while 
  - really helpful to avoid using recursion
  - ```while(condition) {}```
- for
  - syntactic sugar for while loops
  - ```for(var, condition, iterator){}```
    - ```for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)```

### Memory: Incomplete Primer
- memory is composed of many ***bytes***
- Each byte has an ***address***
- Your operating system organizes memory into blocks
- C organizes memory into two parts
  - The Stack
  - The Heap
- The value of ***every*** variable is stored on the Stack
- Everything else is stored in the Heap

### The Stack
- holds the value of every variable
- whjen a variable is ***declared*** space is allocated for it on the stack
- the ***value*** of a variable is stored in the allocated space
  - the type of a variable determines how much space that variable takes up in memory
  - Note: pointers will be 64bits because that is how wide a word is on a modern machine
- Each variable has a ***scope*** -> the portion of the program in which the variable's value is accessible
- A variable goes ***out of scope*** at the end of the block in which it was declared
  - Scope is ***inherited*** by nested blocks
  - Scope is ***not inherited*** by called function bodies 
    - Function bodies do ***NOT*** inherit scope, this fact alone is what enables recursive functions to be implemented in C
  - 

### Aside: Abstraction and Mathematical Models
- A variable is a name for a location in memory
  - Specifically, the name for a location on ***the stack***
- When you refer to a variable, you refer to a variable's value
- If you were to examine memory at a variable's location, you would see a sequence of bits, i.e., 1's and 0's
- But we don't care about the exact sequence of 1's and 0's
- The Abstraction performed by your computer + programming lang
  - Transistors -> logic gates -> bits -> bytes -> int, double char -> all integers, all real numbers, etc ...
- mathematical models
  - must be considering the mathematical basis for all variables. i.e if you were considering an integer, you cannot forget that the bounds for an int is +/- 2^31
  - double is +/- 10^38
  - unsigned int +- <= 2^32 -1
  - float vs double: float has 7 sig digits, double has 15 sig digits. This is a massive difference
- ***ALWAYS*** think about variables in terms of their mathematical models

### Arrays
- An ***array*** in C is
  - A collection of related variables
  - All of the same type
  - With systematically related names using [...] indexed from 0
- Declared like
  - int arr[10];
    - All elements have undefined values until they are assigned
  - An array of 10 ints
- arr is stored on the stack in ***contiguous memory***
  - contiguous memory refers to blocks of memory that are sequential and uninterrupted

### Array Limitations (Stack-Allocated memory)
- Stack memory is decided at compile time -> all the limitations of arrays stem from this feature
- Stack-allocated arrays go out of scope at the end of a function, so you ***CANNOT*** return a stack-allocated array in C
- The length of a stack-allocated array is ***immutable***
  - Once an array is declared, its length ***cannot be changed***
-  The length of a stack-allocated array must be a ***constant***

### What is the Point of a Stack-Allocated Array
- There is ***almost always a better way*** to do something than a stack-allocated array
- Stack-allocated arrays are fundamental to C, so we will use them
- Stack-allocated arrays motivate and scaffold your understanding of ***dynamic arrays***

### Using Arrays
- Given ```int arr[5];```
- Initialize each element
- If you attempt to access a element beyond the size of the array, a buffer overflow error is produced, C returns whatever happens to be at address 42 places beyond arr[0]
```c 
for (int i=0; i <5; i++) {
    arr[i] = i + 1;
}

arr[4] = 6;
arr[0] = arr[4] * arr[3];

arr[42] = 0; // if we put in a bad index, C will see what is at the 42nd element in the array, so it will be whatever is at the memory 42 places beyond the first element arr[0] of the array. This is called a buffer overflow.
```

### Textual Data
- ***Strings*** and ***Character arrays*** are equivalent in C
- Storing a string 
  - ```char text[] = "Hello"```
- So-called C-style strings are terminated with a null character ('\0')
  - length of the array storing a C-style string is one greater than the number of "meaningful" characters in it
  - aka null-terminated strings
  - Backslash ```\``` is an escape character

### Character arrays vs Character Pointers
- char* is a ***character pointer***
  - Typically points to the first character in a heap-allocated array
  - Used in mostly the same way at ***char []***
- String literals are ***not*** stored in the same place as everything else, these are not stored on the heap
- ***String literals*** are  sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. It represents a constant value in the source code and is used to initialize arrays of characters (strings) or for comparison and manipulation of strings.

## Input/Output
- standard streams files
- to do ***any*** input and output in C, you must include stdio
  - #include <stdio.h>, stdio.h = standard intput/output header
  - basic functions of stdio.h
    - size_t, FILE, EOF, stdin, stdout, stderr
    - int printf()
    - int scanf()
    - char *gets()
    - int getchar()
- Standard streams
  - a program communicates with its environment via ***streams***
  - a stream is an abstraction of a file
  - when a program is launched from the terminal
    - ***stdin*** collects keyboard input
    - ***stdout*** writes output to the display
    - ***stderr*** writes outut to the display
  - User can redirect the output or intput using an execution command
    - Input: $ ./myprog < new_in.txt
    - Output: $ ./myprog > new_out.txt
    - Error: $ ./myprog 2> new_err.txt
