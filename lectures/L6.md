# Sorting Algorithms and Pointers in C

## Insertion Sort

- Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by comparisons.
- Worst case : O(n^2)
- Best Case : Omega(n)

## Merge Sort

- Divide and conquer algorithm
- The merge sort algo splits the array into two subarrays, sorts the subarrays using the same algo recursively, nad then merges the subarrays
- Divide operation : O(1)
- Conquer operation : O(n) + 2T(n/2) = O(nlogn)
- In place merge algorithm
- Not in place merge algorithm

## Quick Sort

- Similar to MergeSort. Divide and conquer algo.
- The algo selects an element, called the **pivot**, in the array. The **pivot** element is the dividing point in our partition array. Divide the array into two parts such that all elements in the first part are less than or equal to the pivot and all the elements in the second part are greater than the pivot.
- Recursively apply the quick sort algo to the first part then the second part
- The **pivot selection** strategy playes a HUGE role in the worst-case time of your quicksort algorithm.
  - In the worst case, each time the pivot divies the array into two parts of about the same size, let T(n) denote the time required for sorting an array of elements using quick sort. 
  - So, T(n) = T(n/2) + T(n/2) + n
  - = O(n) + 2T(n/2) = O(nlogn)

## Bubble Sort

- It's ass, but it looks cool
- Simply compare every adjacent pair of items in the array, if they are out of order swap them. You do this until the array is sorted

## Counting Sort

- Assume input has a limited array of range 0 < A[k] < k
  - List of integers with a known maximum value
- Steps
  - Phase One -> O(nk) runtime
    - scan array, find largest value k
    - make array of size k+1, all entries zero
    - scan array again, each time increasing count
  - Phase Two
    - for all entries of count array, k iterations total time O(n+k)
  - O(n)

## Recall the stack

- when a variable is **declared** space is allocated for it on the Stack
- The **value** of a variable is stored in the allocated space
- Each variable has a **scope**
  - The portion of the program in which the variables value is accessible
- A variable is in **scope** once it is declared
- A variable goes out of scope at the **end of the block** in which it was declared
  - Scope is **inherited** by nested blocks
  - Scope is **not inherited** by called function bodies

## The Heap

- Most things you work with in even moderately complex C programs are on the heap
- Memory on the **stack** is **automatically managed** for you by the C runtime
- Memory on the heap is **manually managed** by you, the programmer! Everytime you allocate memory, you **MUST** dealocate it after you use it otherwise you will cause a **memory leak** because this memory is allocated by your program but is no longer usable
- **Allocate it** --> **Use It** -> **Deallocate it**
  - **Allocate:** Enough space on the heap for what you need
  - **Use It:** maybe expanding or shrinking the allocated space
  - **Free:** the space you allocated in step 1

## Memory Allocation

- **Allocate Space on the heap** functions in C 
  - ```void *malloc (size_t, size)```  
    - Allocates size bytes of **uninitialized storage**
  - ```void *calloc (size_t num, size_t size)```
    - Allocates memory for an array of num objects of size bytes each
    - **initializes** all bytes in an unallocated storage to zero
  - Each function returns a **pointer** to the newly-allocated memory
    - Might return null if allocation was unsuccessful
      - This is extremely unlikely

## Pointers : Allocate Space on the Heap

- Indentified by the presence of an **(*)** in the type definition
- Value is the **address** of something in memory
  - The thing that it points too
  - Accessible via the dereference operator **(*)**
- Contains **no size information** about the pointed-to region of memory
  - But size can sometimes be inferred from the **type**
- Common use cases of pointers: **dynamicaly-allocated arrays**
  - Points to the **first element** of the array
- Can also be used with **opaque structs** to enforce data abstraction

## Pointers as arrays : Allocate space on the Heap

- A pointer can be used to point to an array in memory
  - To the first item of an array specifically
  - Recall: an array is a **contiguous chunk** of memory indexable from zero ()
- Ex ```char *name = "Ozan"```
  - **name** is a pointer to char: ```"O"```
  - part of a contiguous chunk of memory with enough space for 5 **chars** ```"O", "z", "a", "n", "\0"```
- Addressable with the subscript syntax ```[0]```
  - Note: ptr[N] is the same as *(ptr + N)
  - name[0] = "0", (equivilently *name)

## Aside: void*

- void* is the type denoting "a pointer to something"
- You should almost **NEVER** declare a variable of type void*
  - Functions deal in void* so they are **generic**
    - **cast** void* to the appropriate type

## What to Store: Temporary Variables

- Temporary memory during lifetime of a function or block
  - Storage for function parameters and local variables
- Need to support nested function calls
  - One function calls another, and so on
  - Store the variables of calling function
  - Know where to return when done
- So, must allow room to grow  
  - Known as the **"stack"**
  - Push on the stack as a new function is called
  - Pop off the stack as the function ends
